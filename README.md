This repo's sole purpose is to gather author names email addresses for
the pending Open MPI conversion from SVN to Git.  This repo will
disappear once the conversion is complete.

When converting from SVN to Git, Git commits are tracked by email
address, not a simple ID.  Hence, we'd like to get a good list of
email addresses to accurately reflect the people who have been
involved in Open MPI over the years.

I have an accurate listing of SVN IDs and names, but I do not
necessarily have everyone's email address correct.

You can make changes to the authors file in multiple ways:

1. Ask me for write perms to this repo
2. Submit a github pull request
3. Email me your changes

PLEASE SUBMIT YOUR UPDATES BY COB, FRIDAY, 15 AUG 2014.

-----

Note that the SVN->Git conversion cannot handle different email addresses
for the same SVN ID over time.  This means:

- If you used the same SVN ID to commit for multiple organizations
  over time, sorry.  The history will reflect only a single email
  address for all your commits.
- Please pick a good email address for you.  You may want to pick an
  email address from your past (especially if you are no longer a
  current Open MPI committer), or you might want to choose your
  current email address.
- If you don't want your email address identified, please give us an
  obviously-fake email address, such as
  myname@git-conversion.open-mpi.org.

Thanks.
